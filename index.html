          <p>
            <b>Manchester United Football Club</b>, commonly referred to as Man
            United (often stylised as Man Utd), or simply United, is a
            professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater
            Manchester, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the
            top division in the English football league system. Nicknamed the
            Red Devils, they were founded as
            <b>Newton Heath LYR Football Club</b> in 1878, but changed their
            name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton,
            Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford,
            in 1910.
          </p>
          <p>
            Domestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 top-flight
            league titles, 12 FA Cups, 6 League Cups and a record 21 FA
            Community Shields. In international football, they have won the
            European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa
            League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the
            Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968,
            under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the
            club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became
            the first English club to win the European Cup. Sir Alex Ferguson is
            the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38
            trophies, including 13 league titles, five FA Cups, and two
            Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013. In the 1998–99
            season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of
            English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier
            League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. In winning the UEFA Europa
            League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs
            to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the
            Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).

            Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs
            in the world and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City,
            Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning
            football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of
            €676.3 million, and the world's third-most-valuable football club in
            2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion). After being floated
            on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in
            2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued
            at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money
            became the club's debt. From 2012, some shares of the club were
            listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family
            retains overall ownership and control of the club.

            <p>
              Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football
              Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and
              Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath. The team initially
              played games against other departments and railway companies, but
              on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match;
              wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they
              were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team. By 1888, the
              club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional
              football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one
              season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed 'Football Alliance',
              which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football
              League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in
              the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the
              railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name. After two
              seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.

              In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £310,000 in
              2024 – the club was served with a winding-up order. Captain Harry
              Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies
              (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return
              for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently
              changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was
              officially born. Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial
              duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in
              1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won
              in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season
              began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended with
              the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First
              Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the
              following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.

              In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following
              the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second
              Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925.
              Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club,
              achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second
              Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John
              Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to
              the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt
              had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931,
              invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the 1938–39
              season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the
              club finished 14th in the First Division.

          <div id="contentHistory2" class="content-history">
            <p>
              In October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the
              war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded
              an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player
              transfers and training sessions. Busby led the team to
              second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup
              victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its
              first league title for 41 years. They then won back-to-back league
              titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22,
              were nicknamed "the Busby Babes" by the media, a testament to
              Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957, Manchester United
              became the first English team to compete in the European Cup,
              despite objections from The Football League, who had denied
              Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the
              semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a
              10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the
              club's biggest victory on record.

              The following season, on the way home from a European Cup
              quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft
              carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists
              crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich,
              Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23
              lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne,
              Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor
              and Billy Whelan – and injured several more.

              Assistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby
              recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached
              the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In
              recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to
              compete in the 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual League
              champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The
              Football Association, The Football League determined that the club
              should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.
            </p>
            <p>
              Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such
              as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next
              generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the
              FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the
              league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester
              United became the first English club to win the European Cup,
              beating Benfica 4–1 in the final with a team that contained three
              European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and
              George Best. They then represented Europe in the 1968
              Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat
              in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford
              three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby
              resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve
              team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.

            <p>
              Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor
              start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily
              resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position
              as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed
              as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced
              by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester
              United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in
              1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left
              the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached
              the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They
              reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty
              was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his
              affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977.
              Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary
              Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they
              finished second in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup
              final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the
              last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by Ron
              Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to
              sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under
              Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and
              beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985–86,
              after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was
              favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The
              following season, with the club in danger of relegation by
              November, Atkinson was dismissed.

              Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen
              on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an
              11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in
              1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.
              Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was
              saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final. The
              following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup
              Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in
              the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat
              European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford. The
              club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and
              1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that
              competition for the first time as well. In 1993, in the first
              season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their
              first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first
              time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside
              the FA Cup – to complete the first "Double" in the club's history.
              United then became the first English club to do the Double twice
              when they won both competitions again in 1995–96, before retaining
              the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.

              In the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first team to
              win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – "The
              Treble" – in the same season. Trailing 1–0 going into injury time
              in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole
              Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over
              Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks
              of all time. That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his
              services to football.

            <p>
              In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever
              win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1–0 victory over the strong
              1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils
              counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World
              Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the
              game.

              Manchester United won the league again in the 1999–2000 and
              2000–01 seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English
              title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001–02,
              before regaining the title in 2002–03. They won the 2003–04 FA
              Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium
              in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the
              2005–06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the
              knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in
              over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league
              finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League
              Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the
              2006–07 season, before completing the European double in 2007–08
              with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA
              Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English
              league title.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that
              game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In
              December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the
              FIFA Club World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1–0 in the final.
              Manchester United followed this with the 2008–09 Football League
              Cup, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer,
              forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world
              record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston
              Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first
              successful defence of a knockout cup competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season,
              United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010–11, securing
              the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on
              14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13,
              securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa
              on 22 April 2013.

              On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager
              at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as
              a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated
              manager in football history. The club announced the next day that
              Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having
              signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim
              player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was
              sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend
              their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA
              Champions League for the first time since 1995–96. They also
              failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time
              Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition
              since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal
              would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year
              deal, with Giggs as his assistant. Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch
              of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014
            </p>
            <p class="flexwrap-text">
              Under Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing
              slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the
              board sounding out potential replacements. Van Gaal was ultimately
              sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United
              having finished fifth in the league. Former Porto, Chelsea, Inter
              Milan and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho was appointed in his
              place on 27 May 2016. Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and
              in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and UEFA
              Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a
              stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against Stoke City in
              January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time
              top scorer. The following season, United finished second in the
              league – their highest league placing since 2013 – but were still
              19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the
              club to a 19th FA Cup final, but they lost 1–0 to Chelsea. On 18
              December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League
              table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside
              the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games
              in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar
              Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the
              season. On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches
              in charge, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager on a
              three-year deal.

              On 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11
              other European clubs as founding members of the European Super
              League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA
              Champions League. The announcement drew a significant backlash
              from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players
              and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days
              later. The failure of the project led to the resignation of
              executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant protests
              against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion
              ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw
              the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter
              protests in the competition's history.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win
              in Premier League history with a 9–0 win over Southampton on 2
              February 2021, but ended the season with defeat on penalties in
              the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, going four
              straight seasons without a trophy. On 20 November 2021, Solskjær
              left his role as manager. Former midfielder Michael Carrick took
              charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf
              Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.
            </p>
            <p>
              On 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from
              the end of the 2021–22 season, signing a contract until June 2025
              with the option of extending for a further year. Ten Hag won
              Manchester United the 2022–23 EFL Cup against Newcastle United,
              winning 2–0. On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their
              joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7–0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield.
